# Barebones dialogue tree system for DOTA 2

This is not a complete system, it is only the bare essentials to get started.

When I made this in January 6th 2017, there existed no dialogue system for DOTA 2. This is the result of extensive research, since the documentation was partly obsolete or of poor quality. There's a lot of hidden knowledge you can only get from other modders.

Also the custom game system was limited in frustrating ways which prevents many of the best ways to accomplish certain tasks.
